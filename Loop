The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for, while, do while or for-in loops. 
It makes the code compact. It is mostly used in array.

There are four types of loops in JavaScript.
1). for loop -->> The JavaScript for loop iterates the elements for the fixed number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is known.
                  for (initialization; condition; increment){  
                      code to be executed  
                  }  

2). while loop -->> The JavaScript while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is not known. 
                    while (condition) {  
                        code to be executed  
                    }  

3). do-while loop -->> The JavaScript do while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times like while loop. 
                       But, code is executed at least once whether condition is true or false. 
                       do{  
                          code to be executed  
                      }while (condition);  


4). for-in loop -->> The JavaScript for in loop is used to iterate the properties of an object.


for example :-- Check whether the no is prime or not -->>>
                                                      var flag = true;
                                                      var n = 11;
                                                      for(let i = 2 ; i < n ;i++){
                                                          if(n % i == 0){
                                                              flag = false;
                                                              break
                                                          }
                                                      }
                                                      if(flag){
                                                          console.log('prime');
                                                      }else{
                                                          console.log("not prime")
                                                      }

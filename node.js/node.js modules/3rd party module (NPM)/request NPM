Request is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. 
I will return html code of a particular page which you are going to request.
It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.

Installation --->> npm i request




console.log("before")
const request = require('request')
request("https://www.worldometers.info//coronavirus//" , cb)

function cb(error, response, html) {
    console.error('error:', error); // Print the error if one occurred
    console.log('statusCode:', response && response.statusCode); // Print the response status code if a response was received
    console.log('html:', html); // Print the HTML for the Google homepage.
  }

console.log("after")

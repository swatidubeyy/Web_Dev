**********************************************************************Node.js Modules**********************************************************************************

In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicates with an external application on the basis of their related functionality. 
Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders. 
The reason programmers are heavily reliant on modules is because of their re-usability as well as the ability to break down
a complex piece of code into manageable chunks.


Modules are of three types: ---->>>
                                  Core Modules
                                  local Modules
                                  Third-party Modules
                                  
                                  
                                  
*********************************************************************************Core Modules**************************************************************************


Node.js has many built-in modules that are part of the platform and comes with Node.js installation.
These modules can be loaded into the program by using the require function.

Syntax:---->>>>> var module = require('module_name');
The require() function will return a JavaScript type depending on what the particular module returns. 

some imp core modules --->>>
                            http ------>>>>	creates an HTTP server in Node.js.
                            assert ------>>>> set of assertion functions useful for testing.
                            fs ------>>>> used to handle file system.
                            path ------>>>> includes methods to deal with file paths.
                            process ------>>>> provides information and control about the current Node.js process.
                            os ------>>>> provides information about the operating system.
                            querystring ------>>>> utility used for parsing and formatting URL query strings.
                            url ------>>>> module provides utilities for URL resolution and parsing.
                            
                            
                            
*********************************************************************************Local Modules**************************************************************************

Unlike built-in and external modules, local modules are created locally in your Node.js application. 
Letâ€™s create a simple calculating module that calculates various operations. Create a calc.js file that has the following code:
exampe --->>>> Import - export


*********************************************************************************Third-party modules*********************************************************************

Third-party modules are modules that are available online using the Node Package Manager(NPM).
These modules can be installed in the project folder or globally. Some of the popular third-party modules are mongoose, express, angular, and react.

Example: --->>>>>
                  npm install express
                  npm install mongoose
                  npm install -g @angular/cli

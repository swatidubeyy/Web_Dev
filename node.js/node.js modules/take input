let input = process.argv[2]
console.log(input)

Why 2 is in array ----->>>
              Because we can put input at the second index only as we know that---->>>>>>
                                                                                          0th index will be node
                                                                                          1st index will be file name which will be going to be executed.
                                                                                          2nd index for our input which we want
Node js treats command line input as an array and that array is your process array.

Select the last element of a specific type
:last-of-type
Selects each last element of that type within another element. Remember type refers the kind of tag, so p and span are different types.

I wonder if this is how the last dinosaur was selected before it went extinct.


Example --->>> Select the last apple and orange

            <div class="table">
            <orange class="small" />
            <orange class="small" />
            <pickle />
            <pickle />
            <apple class="small" />
            <apple class="small" />
            </div>

ans --->> .small:last-of-type

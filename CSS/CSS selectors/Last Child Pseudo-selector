Select the last element inside of another element
:last-child
You can use this selector to select an element that is the last child element inside of another element.

Pro Tip â†’ In cases where there is only one element, that element counts as the first-child, only-child and last-child!


example --->> Select the small apple and the pickle

            <div class="table">
            <plate id="fancy">
            <apple class="small" />
            </plate>
            <plate />
            <plate>
            <orange class="small" />
            <orange />
            </plate>
            <pickle class="small" />
            </div> 
 
 
ans --->> .small:last-child

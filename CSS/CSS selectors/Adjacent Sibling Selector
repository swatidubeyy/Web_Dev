Select an element that directly follows another element
A + B
This selects all B elements that directly follow A. Elements that follow one another are called siblings. They're on the same level, or depth.

In the HTML markup for this level, elements that have the same indentation are siblings.


Example --->>>  Select every apple that's next to a plate

            <div class="table">
            <bento>
            <apple class="small" />
            </bento>
            <plate />
            <apple class="small" />
            <plate />
            <apple />
            <apple class="small" />
            <apple class="small" />
            </div>

ans ---->>>  plate + apple

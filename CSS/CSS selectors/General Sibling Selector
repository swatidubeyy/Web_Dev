Select elements that follows another element
A ~ B
You can select all siblings of an element that follow it.
This is like the Adjacent Selector (A + B) except it gets all of the following elements instead of one.

Example --->> Select the pickles beside the bento

            <div class="table">
              <pickle />
            <bento>
            <orange class="small" />
            </bento>
            <pickle class="small" />
            <pickle />
            <plate>
            <pickle />
            </plate>
            <plate>
            <pickle class="small" />
            </plate>
            </div>

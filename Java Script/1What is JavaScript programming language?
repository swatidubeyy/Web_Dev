The programs in this language are called scripts.

They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

Scripts are provided and executed as plain text.

JS is a Synchronus langauge ( Line by line ) and single threded langauge (which means only one statement is executed at a time.).

JS is a Dynamic langauge (Being able to change the underlying type of a variable while the program is running without causing an error 
is what makes JavaScript a dynamic language. This behavior comes with both benefits and drawbacks. that means in js we don't need to define type of variable like 
int, float etc and here we can reasign values).

They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.

The first JavaScript engine was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 for the Netscape Navigator web browser.
It was a rudimentary interpreter for the nascent language Eich invented.(This evolved into the SpiderMonkey engine, still used by the Firefox browser.)

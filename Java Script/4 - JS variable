JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. 
First the variable is initialized automatically by Undefined.

variable declaration with VAR -->> (var a =  2)
                             var keyword has many problems -->> 
                                    1) It can accidentally overwrite an existing global variable(that means we can redeclare a single var many times).
                                    2) Function scoping and block scoping ( that means it can be dangerous that we can access and redeclare variable ,
                                       we can print the value of variable which is in loop or control statement or function ).


variable declaration with LET -->> (let a = 2)
                              Doesn't allow redeclaration of variables.


variable declaration with CONST -->> (const a = 2)
                                    Doesn't allow reasign of variables. ( if const a = 2 then you can't reasign a = " Hello " ).
                                    
                                    And where you are writing const you have to assign value there(Because it's by default contains 'Undefind value' so, 
                                    if you will not assign then after that you can't resign const also , so it will remain undefined)

Reassign ---->
             let a = 2 ;
             a = 5;

Redeclare ---->
               var a = 2;
               var a = 5;
